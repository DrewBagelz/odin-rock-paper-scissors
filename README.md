# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors project for The Odin Project.

## Overview

A five-round game of Rock, Paper, Scissors to be played in the
browser console, written in JavaScript.

## Reflections

This was my first attempt at writing JavaScript and it turned out to
be a pretty humbling experience. There were so many "unknown
unknowns" that I barely knew how to look for help. The only part of
the code that I was able to do confidently on my own was the
`if...else` statements needed to determine the winner of each round.
However, in my struggles I was able to learn a lot of new information
that will hopefully make things easier in the future. I learned about
the `math.floor()` and `math.random` methods and how to use them to
return a random item from an `Array`. I also got a sneak peek at
loops. Most importantly, I realized creating a `Function` does
nothing unless the `Function` is actually called elsewhere in the
code or console, which probably should have been obvious, but
figuring that out got rid of a lot of confusion about what was going
wrong and why.
