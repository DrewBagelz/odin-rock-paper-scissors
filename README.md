# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors project for The Odin Project.

## Overview

A five-round game of Rock, Paper, Scissors to be played in the
browser console, written in JavaScript.

## Reflections

This was my first attempt at writing JavaScript and it turned out to
be a pretty humbling experience. There were so many "unknown
unknowns" that I barely knew how to look for help. The only part of
the code that I was able to do confidently on my own was the
`if...else` statements needed to determine the winner of each round.
However, in my struggles I was able to learn a lot of new information
that will hopefully make things easier in the future. I learned about
the `math.floor()` and `math.random()` methods and how to use them to
return a random item from an `Array`. I also got a sneak peek at
loops. Most importantly, I realized creating a `Function` does
nothing unless the `Function` is actually called elsewhere in the
code or console, which probably should have been obvious, but
figuring that out got rid of a lot of confusion about what was going
wrong and why.

## UI Update

I was much better prepared for this leg of the project and didn't
need to look up much of anything to complete it. The only thing
that tripped me up was the "Play Again?" button, but an easy fix
spontaneously came to me while eating dinner one night. I'm not sure
if my solution is the most efficient way to go about it, but it
works, and the project wasn't even asking me to do it, I just
wanted to see if I could at this stage. I could add some CSS to
pretty it up, but moving on to the next JavaScript lessons feels
like a better use of my time. I'm keeping the old console-only
script here for posterity. It was the first thing I ever coded and I
didn't want to lose it in a merge.
